# Strategy Pattern in Software Design

The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. The pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to be selected dynamically based on the context, without altering the client code that uses the algorithm.

## Key Characteristics
- **Dynamic Behavior:** The Strategy pattern allows the algorithm to be chosen at runtime, making the system more flexible.
- **Encapsulation of Algorithms:** Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own strategy class, promoting the separation of concerns.
- **Interchangeability:** The Strategy pattern allows you to switch algorithms easily, as the client interacts with a common interface.

## Structure

### 1. **Strategy Interface**
The Strategy interface defines a common method that all concrete strategies must implement. This method represents the behavior that is varied.

### 2. **Concrete Strategies**
Each concrete strategy implements the Strategy interface and provides a specific implementation of the algorithm.

### 3. **Context**
The Context class holds a reference to the current strategy and provides a method for setting a different strategy. The Context class delegates the execution of the algorithm to the strategy.

## Advantages
- **Open/Closed Principle:** The Strategy pattern promotes the open/closed principle by allowing you to add new strategies without modifying the client code.
- **Flexibility:** The pattern provides flexibility to change the algorithm used at runtime.
- **Simplification:** By encapsulating the behavior in separate classes, the code is more maintainable and easier to extend.

## Disadvantages
- **Increased Complexity:** The Strategy pattern introduces additional classes, which may increase the complexity of the system.
- **Client Awareness:** The client needs to be aware of the available strategies and explicitly choose the appropriate one.

## Common Use Cases
1. **Payment Processing Systems:** A payment system that supports multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.), where the algorithm for processing payments changes based on the selected method.
2. **Sorting Algorithms:** A system that can dynamically choose different sorting algorithms (quick sort, bubble sort, etc.) based on the size of the data set.
3. **Rendering Systems:** A rendering system that can switch between different rendering techniques (wireframe, 3D, textures) based on user preferences or hardware capabilities.
